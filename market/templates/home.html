            <p>A non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) system, also called energy
                disaggregation systems, allows to obtain information relating to the power
                absorption of individual appliances. The first NILM system was proposed by
                George W. Hart in 1985. Load monitoring and identification is a method of determining electrical
                energy consumption of individual appliances based on the analysis of composite
                load measured from the main power meter in a building. They can supply information such as type of load, electricity consumption
                details of the appliances to both the consumer and the utility. This information can
                be used to formulate load plan strategies for optimal energy utilization. </p>
